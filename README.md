This project was generated with vite.
Fork it, clone it in your computer and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

To switch to the `adding-routing` branch run `git checkout adding-routing` and run `npm install` again. This branch includes a new package called `react-router-dom` that will help us to add routing to our project.
